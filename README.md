# undergradR
Material for an undergraduate R lab.

Originally developed Fall 2016 for California University of Pennsylvania's Design & Analysis course for the Department of Environmental & Biological Sciences.

Each folder contains all materials for a single lab.  This can include

* R code
* data files
* Power Point presentations

R code is generally given as a RMarkdown .Rmd file which can be rendered by RStudio into a website or Word file.  A standard R script (.R) may also be present which has the RMarkdown formatting removed. 

Some materials may also be present which are intended to be handouts or exercises.
