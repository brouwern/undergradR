# Chapter 3 Question 28


```{r}
AA <- c(0.58,0.59,0.69,.72,.78,.78,.81,.85,.85,.92,.93,.95)
BB <- c(0.15,.22,.3,.37,.38,.5,.9)

```



# Histograms with default margins determine by R

R doesn't know that we want to compare the histograms, so it adjusts each one indepdently to fit the data.  Why might this be a problem?

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(AA, ylab = "", lwd = 2)

hist(BB, ylab = c(""),lwd = 2)

```



# Histograms with margins adjusted so that both are on same scale
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
ylim. <- c(0,4)
xlim. <- c(0,1)
hist(AA, ylab = "", ylim = ylim., xlim = xlim., lwd = 2)
hist(BB, ylab = c(""), ylim = ylim., xlim = xlim., lwd = 2)

```
